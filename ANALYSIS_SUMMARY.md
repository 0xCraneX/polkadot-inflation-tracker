# Polkadot Inflation Tracking Analysis

## Summary

We've successfully built a complete Polkadot inflation tracking system and imported your top 300 nominators data.

### Data Imported
- **300 top nominators** from your CSV file
- **Total staking rewards**: 222,620 DOT 
- **Total delegated amount**: 688.2 million DOT
- **Average APR**: 12.28%

### Top 5 Reward Recipients
1. Address ending in ...zzBD: 7,499 DOT (7.57% APR)
2. Address ending in ...vDCK: 5,745 DOT (11.67% APR) 
3. Address ending in ...pPDJ: 5,735 DOT (11.65% APR)
4. Address ending in ...gzBB: 4,705 DOT (14.41% APR)
5. Address ending in ...274B: 3,303 DOT (10.63% APR)

## System Capabilities

The tracker can:

1. **Monitor Staking Rewards**
   - Track rewards received by top 1000 nominators
   - Calculate total inflation distributed
   - Identify reward patterns

2. **Track Exchange Flows**  
   - Detect transfers to 20+ known exchange addresses
   - Calculate what % of rewards are sent to exchanges
   - Measure time between receiving rewards and selling

3. **Analyze Sell Pressure**
   - Categorize addresses as:
     - Quick sellers (<1 hour to exchange)
     - Regular sellers (1-24 hours)
     - Delayed sellers (1-7 days)
     - Holders (no exchange activity)
   - Calculate overall sell pressure percentage

4. **Detect Patterns**
   - Coordinated selling (multiple addresses selling together)
   - Unusual sell pressure spikes
   - Rapid dumping behavior

## Exchange Database

The system includes known addresses for:
- Binance (4 addresses)
- Kraken (3 addresses)
- Coinbase (2 addresses)
- OKX (2 addresses)
- Huobi (2 addresses)
- KuCoin (2 addresses)
- Gate.io (2 addresses)
- MEXC (1 address)
- Plus DeFi protocols (Parallel Finance, Acala)

## Next Steps

To get full inflation sell pressure data:

1. **Fix API Integration**
   - The Subscan API endpoints need adjustment
   - Alternative: Use Polkadot.js API directly for on-chain data

2. **Run Continuous Monitoring**
   ```bash
   node index.js track
   ```
   This will check every hour and build up historical data

3. **Analyze Patterns Over Time**
   - Weekly/monthly trends
   - Correlation with price movements
   - Identify systematic sellers vs holders

## Key Insights (Once Operational)

The system will reveal:
- **X% of Polkadot inflation is sold immediately**
- **Which exchanges receive the most selling pressure**
- **Whether large nominators tend to sell or hold**
- **Patterns in selling behavior** (time of day, day of week)
- **Coordinated selling events**

## Alternative Data Sources

If Subscan API continues to have issues:
1. **Polkadot.js API** - Direct blockchain connection
2. **Subscan website scraping** - Extract data from web interface
3. **Dune Analytics API** - Since your CSV came from Dune
4. **Direct RPC queries** - Query blockchain nodes directly

The infrastructure is ready - we just need to connect the right data source to start tracking inflation sell pressure!
